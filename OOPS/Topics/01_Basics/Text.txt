Objects = The entities of real world
Class = The blueprint of Objects

Syntax of Class
class classname {
    properties/attributes such as name,age etc
    methods(functions which are written inside a class)/functions/member functions(called so cause they are members of a class)
};


Constructor = Special method invoked automatically(automatically called by c++ whenever we create a new obj) at time of obj creation.Used for initialization

Class is just a bp it does not occupy space in memory but the objects created by the bp occupies space in memory 

Properties of Constructor
same name as class
Constructor does not have a return type
only called once(automatically),at obj creation
memory allocation happens when Constructor is called i.e when a obj is created

Constructor is declared as public as it need to get access of member functions

Constructor is of 3 types:
Non-parameterized(no parameters inside constructor)
parameterized
copy

There can be more than one constructor inside a class if they have totally different parameters 

The phenomenon in which we can have multiple constructors which may have same name but are of different type is called constructor overloading and constructor overloading is an example of polymorphism

this pointer
this is a special pointer in C++ that points to current obj
this->prop is same as *(this).prop  
let obj is calling a function but the function wants to refer the properties of this obj so either this function can access this properties by writing property or we can write this->property   
obj.func()

int x=10
int*ptr=&x;
*ptr here
 * is dereferencing operator means dereferencing pointer i.e the value that pointer points to x having value 10 then *ptr means we are talking ab 10

*this means obj
to access property we can write 
(*this).prop means obj.prop 

Copy constructor = Special constructor(default) used to copy properties of one obj to another 

Copy is of 2 types 
Shallow copy of an obj copies all of the member values from one obj to another but the issue is when we create a new memory allocation inside heap or using pointers
Deep copy not only copies the member values but also makes copies of any dynamically allocated memory that members point to

Destructor = Opposite of constructor i.e deallocate the memory(deleting the computer system's memory).It is a special function & compiler makes self-Destructor we don't make it

In c++ any obj created dynamically we have to delete it dynamically as we create by using new keyword so we have to delete it by using delete keyword
Ex deletePtr meaning delete the memory that the pointer is pointing to but pointer doesn't get deleted
